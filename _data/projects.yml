- name: Infectious Disease Modelling and Seasonality in Diseases
  descr: "Reviewed and simulated simple epidemic models and temporally forced models; 
          Performed time-dependent spectral analysis of epidemiological time-series with wavelet power spectrums on Smallpox and H1N1 Data;
          Simulated an SIR Model and estimated &beta for H1N1 Data in India."

- name: Non-discretization Schemes in Biological Systems
  descr: "Reviewed numerical schemes that produce differential equations whose dynamics remains unchanged from the underlying continuous equation;
          Simulated Predator-prey, cooperation and competition Lotka-Volterra models;
          Compared local and global stability of systems before and after applying numerical schemes;"

- name: Customer Churn Prediction
  descr: "Detected which customers are likely to cancel a subscription to a service based on how they use the service;
          Predicted the customer churning using Logistic Regression, Classification Tree and Random Forest algorithms."

- name: Churn Analysis
  descr: "Used a Hidden Markov Model to predict churning customers;
         Employed the Forward Algorithm, Viterbi Algorithm and Baum-Welch Algorithm to predict the probability of 4 corresponding observational states and using the training set, computed the probabilities of churning for each customer before using it on the test set."
